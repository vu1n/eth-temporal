## How to start

### Temporal cluster
The project uses a (slightly) modified docker-compose from [Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose)

To spin up the Temporal cluster

`$ make up`

To destroy the cluster

`$ make down`

To stop the cluster

`$ make stop`

### Start fetching blocks
The included go program will spawn worker processes to fetch new blocks, starting from the `LATEST` block and incrementing from there.

`$ make fetch`

### Backfilling
Add the backfill tasks:

`$ go run ./backfiller/ -start 200 -end 210 -size 3`

### API
Make an HTTP GET request to:

`http://localhost:8081/blockNumber/{blockNumber}[0-9]+`

`http://localhost:8081/traceBlock/{blockNumber}[0-9]+`
